# state-machine (Pattern Matching Implementation) - 
# Overview :
  It works on a pattern matching algorithm, and provides a unique ID for a unique pattern, without any type of collision.
  Coming to its implementation it is a two Dimensional array. One dimension is for printable ASCII code, second dimension 
  is for state of state machine. This algorithm when used for comparing the string requires O(1) complexity. 
  Its complexity those not depend on the number of pattern.
